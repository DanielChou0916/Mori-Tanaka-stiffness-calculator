# Mori-Tanaka Stiffness Calculator

This package provides tools for calculating the **Mori-Tanaka effective stiffness** of a two-phase composite material.  
It is implemented in **MATLAB** and is inspired by the work of **Dr. TingTing Xu** ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gtsbipkAAAAJ&hl=en)).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In the presented **2D plane strain example**, a **matrix-inclusion composite** is considered, where the inclusion phase is recognized as **cavities (cracks)**, leading to a zero stiffness tensor for inclusion:

</p>

- **Crack 1 orientation** is stationary.  
- **Crack 2 orientation** varies (as shown in the figure below).  
- **Crack spacing** (horizontal & vertical distances) does not influence the Mori-Tanaka scheme, though it is illustrated for reference.

</p>

It is noteworthy that this structure is assumed to be sufficient to represent the microstructure.  
Users should carefully consider the concept of **Representative Elementary Volume (REV)** before using this package.

## ðŸ›  Usage

This package includes both **numerical** and **analytical** approaches for calculating the effective stiffness tensor:

</p>

### **ðŸ”¹ Numerical Calculation**
The script **`Numerical_calculation_Chom.m`** demonstrates how to compute **C_hom** using numerical techniques.

### **ðŸ”¹ Analytical Calculation**
The script **`Analytical_calculation_Chom.m`** provides an analytical solution for Mori-Tanaka stiffness using a **cylindrical-shaped inclusion**, which is equivalent to the 2D plane strain case.
